# Simulating natural selection

The goal is to simulate, entirely in C++, Natural Selection process with "cells". These cells have extremely simple behaviour, such as moving, eating and multiplying.
This project is based on a previous project of mine, [Natural Selection in Unity5](https://github.com/RedZunder/NaturalSelection).
